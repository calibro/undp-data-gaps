          In September 2015, the Heads of State and Government and High
          Representatives decided on new global Sustainable Development Goals
          (SDGs). The 17 SDGs and 169 targets which have been adopted
          demonstrate the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
          Development. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three
          dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and
          environmental. But to measure progress and ensure that no one is left
          behind, the availability of high-quality, accessible, timely and
          reliable data that is disaggregated by income, gender, age, race,
          ethnicity, disability, geographic location and other characteristics
          relevant to countries is key.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4 mb-4 mb-lg-5">
          In July 2017, the UN General Assembly adopted a global indicator
          framework to monitor this Agenda. The 232 global indicators are
          complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels as
          developed by Member States. Data from national statistical and data
          systems are the basis for the compilation of these global indicators.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4 mb-4 mb-lg-5">
          The SDGs Data Availability and Data Gaps in the Arab Region dashboard
          aims to stimulate an informed dialogue on the state of SDGs data. By
          offering a proxy assessment of a countryâ€™s statistical capacity, it
          aims to bring together different data communities of producers and
          users to explore how best to harness the power of technology and
          innovative tools to fulfill the data demands of this Agenda and ensure
          that no one is left behind. Refer to the methodology note for more
          information on how data availability has been measured in this
          endeavour.
